                    running up to the main event, where they’ll get to meet the park staff and leading conservationists,
                    attend cultural evenings and a celebration in Musanze, tour the little-visited lakes Burero and
                    Ruhondo, and finally attend the naming ceremony, where there’s music, dancing, and discussion on the
                    great strides that Rwanda has made in gorilla conservation, and the great challenges that remain.

            <p>Amasunzu is a traditional Rwandan hairstyle that was once worn by men and women. The unique style is created by cutting some of the hair sideways and braiding the top.

                <p>Translated from Kinyarwanda as “coming together in common purpose to achieve an outcome”, Umuganda is when Rwandans from all walks of life come together to work for the good of their neighbourhoods and their nation as a whole. The last Saturday of every month, shops are closed, buses stop running, traffic disappears from the roads, and Rwandans set aside their personal business for the morning and contribute their efforts to public works projects around the country, which can include litter cleanup, tree planting, building houses for the vulnerable, and more. The social and economic benefits of Umuganda are easy for all to see (Rwanda isn’t the cleanest country in Africa by accident!), and whether or not you have special skills to contribute, all visitors are warmly invited to take part; given the range of projects addressed through Umuganda, you’re sure to find one to fit your interests.</p>

                <h4>Intore Dancing</h4>
                <p>The finest displays of Rwanda’s dynamic traditional musical and dance styles are performed by the Intore Dance Troupes. Founded several centuries ago, the Intore, (The Chosen Ones) who performed exclusively for the Royal Court, were given military training and taught the technique of jumping which forms a significant part of the dance. Performed wearing grass wigs and clutching spears this dance is a true spectacle of Rwanda.
                    Live dance performances can be seen at cultural villages, museums and as entertainment at many lodges and hotels across Rwanda. The Gorilla Guardians village in Musanze, and the National Museum of Rwanda have regular performances.</p>
